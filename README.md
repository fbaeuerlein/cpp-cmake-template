## Quickstart

Simply clone the repository and start building.

    git clone REPO.git

    cd REPO
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. 
    make

To check your compiler command line calls, simply use `make VERBOSE=1`.

## Requirements

The requirements to build this project are derived from the build requirements of [Googletest 1.11.0](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases/tag/release-1.11.0) and [Benchmark 1.6.1](https://github.com/google/benchmark/releases/tag/v1.6.1). So just have a look at theirs.

To use the project version information in cmake, the minimum required version is set to 3.10.0. Remove the project version settings if you need a 2.x cmake version.

## Project structure

Besides the unittest and benchmark executables no other libraries or executables are defined within the cmake configuration. So adapt the rest according to your requirements.

```text

│    ├── benchmark/       -> submodule containing google benchmark
│    └── googletest/      -> submodule containing googletest/mock

└── test/
    ├── benchmark/

        ├── CMakeLists.txt        -> definitions of unittest executables
        └── MyFirstTest.cpp       -> example implementation of unittests
```
## Configuration

Project specific settings can be applied at the CMakeLists.txt file within the top level folder. Change the project name and compiler flags accordingly.

If you're using clang-format, update or overwrite the .clang-format file also.
